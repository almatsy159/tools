  - get alias has been done and removed but is easily implmentable and should be
  - a traitement of comment would be pertinent
  - detecting more type of instruction
  - dealing with multiline
  - should be usable in apps !!! may create a branch for that => render dashbord => json => html
  - data analysis project here , maybe in apps so it has content

this program need an sql database and classic db setting
